## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Correctness of Knuth's algorithm for prime numbers
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-bertrand
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/bertrand.git
cd bertrand
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Description

This project consists of:

- A proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in
  "The Art of Computer Programming: Fundamental Algorithms" by Knuth,
  pages 147-149.

- A proof of Bertrand's postulate: there always exists a prime between
  n and 2n for n greater than 2 (`Bertrand.v`).

- A little program that generates a partition of 1..2n in pairs (i,j)
  such that i+j is always prime (`run_partition.ml`).
  The proof of correctness of this program is a direct consequence of
  Bertrand's postulate (`Partition.v`). This nice application of Bertrand's
  postulate was suggested by Gérard Huet.
