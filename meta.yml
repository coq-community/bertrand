synopsis: Coq proof of Bertrand's postulate on existence of primes

description: |-
  A Coq proof of Bertrand's postulate, which says that there always
  exists a prime between n and 2n for n greater than 2. Includes
  an application of the postulate to compute partitions.

  ## Contents

  This project consists of:

  - A Coq proof of Bertrand's postulate: there always exists a prime between
    n and 2n for n greater than 2 (`Bertrand.v`).
  - A proof of correctness of an implementation of the algorithm for computing primes
    described in "The Art of Computer Programming: Fundamental Algorithms" by Knuth,
    pages 147-149. The proof uses the [Why3 tool](http://why3.lri.fr) to generate
    verification conditions for the WhyML program that implements the algorithm.
    These verification conditions can then be discharged by Coq and the
    [Alt-Ergo](https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com) prover.
  - A little program in OCaml that generates a partition of 1..2n in pairs (i,j)
    such that i+j is always prime (`run_partition.ml`). The proof of correctness
    of this program is a direct consequence of Bertrand's postulate (`Partition.v`).
    This nice application of Bertrand's postulate was suggested by Gérard Huet.

  ## Checking WhyML program correctness

  To check the correctness of the WhyML program, first make sure
  the following packages are installed (in addition to Coq 8.12.1 and
  the proof of Bertrand's postulate):

  - [Alt-Ergo 2.3.3](https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com)
  - [Why3 1.3.3](http://why3.lri.fr) and its Coq library

  These packages can be installed via OPAM using the following command:
  ```
  opam install alt-ergo.2.3.3 why3.1.3.3 why3-coq
  ```
  Then, the Why3 proof can be replayed by running
  ```
  make why
  ```
