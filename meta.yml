  ## Description

  This project consists of:

  - A proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in
    "The Art of Computer Programming: Fundamental Algorithms" by Knuth,
    pages 147-149.

  - A proof of Bertrand's postulate: there always exists a prime between
    n and 2n for n greater than 2 (`Bertrand.v`).

  - A little program that generates a partition of 1..2n in pairs (i,j)
    such that i+j is always prime (`run_partition.ml`).
    The proof of correctness of this program is a direct consequence of
    Bertrand's postulate (`Partition.v`). This nice application of Bertrand's
    postulate was suggested by Gérard Huet.
