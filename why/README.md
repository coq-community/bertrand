# WhyML program for computing primes

This directory contains the [Why3](http://why3.lri.fr) files implementing
the algorithm described in "The Art of Computer Programming: Fundamental Algorithms" by Knuth,
pages 147-149, that computes the first `n` primes numbers.

Assuming all requirements are installed, including Why3, Alt-Ergo, Coq 8.12.1, and the Coq proof
of Bertrand's postulate, the Why3 correctness proof can be replayed by simply running `make`.
